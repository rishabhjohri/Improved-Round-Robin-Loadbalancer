# ☁️ Improved Weighted Round Robin (IWRR) Load Balancer – CloudSim Project

This project implements an **Improved Weighted Round Robin (IWRR)** load balancing algorithm in a simulated cloud computing environment using **CloudSim**. The system dynamically assigns incoming tasks to the most suitable virtual machines (VMs) based on their current load, processing capacity, and task length—improving over basic Round Robin (RR) and Weighted RR (WRR).

---

## 🚀 Features

- Task-aware and VM-capacity-aware scheduling
- Dynamic load redistribution (task migration)
- Lower execution time and delays
- Simulation using **CloudSim 3.0.3**
- Python-based performance analysis (execution time, delay, migration, re-execution)

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions (WSL Recommended)

### Prerequisites

- Ubuntu (WSL2 or native)
- Java JDK 11+
- Python 3.8+
- Git, pip

### One-click setup (recommended)
Run this in your WSL terminal:

```bash
bash setup_iwrr_env.sh       # Installs Java, Python libs, and CloudSim
bash setup_project_structure.sh   # Creates project folder layout
```

---

## 🧐 Core Files

- **`Scheduler.java`**: Initializes datacenter, VMs, cloudlets; invokes load balancer
- **`IWRRLoadBalancer.java`**: Implements the improved load balancing logic
- **`analyze_results.py`**: Visualizes execution time, task migration, delays, etc.
- **`execution_log_full.csv`**: Logs metrics for each simulation batch

---

## 📈 Outputs

- **Execution Time vs Task Count**
- **Task Migration Time**
- **Delayed Tasks Count**
- **Re-executed Instructions**

Generated by running:

```bash
python3 scripts/analyze_results.py
```

## 📊 Performance Insights

| Metric                     | IWRR         | WRR        | RR         |
|---------------------------|--------------|------------|------------|
| Execution Time (100 tasks)| ✅ 2 ms       | 5.3 ms     | 8.1 ms     |
| Task Migration Time       | ✅ 0.1 ms     | 0.5 ms     | 5.5 ms     |
| Delayed Tasks             | ✅ 0          | 20         | 100        |
| Instructions Re-executed  | ✅ 900        | 0–1000     | 950–1500   |
